# Constructor-and-Destructor-in-C-plus-plus

## Aim:

To study about the constructor and destructor in C++.

## Theory:

**1. Constrcutor**: A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object is created.

- It has the same name as the class.

- It's main purpose is to initialize the data members of a class.

##### Key Features

- Same name as the class.

- No return type(not even void).

- Invoked automatically when an object is created.

- Can be overloaded(multiple constructors in the same class).

- Can have default arguments.

##### Types of Constructors

- Default contructor: No parameters, initializes with default values.

- Parameterized constructor: Takes parameters to assign user-defined values.

- Copy constructor: Initializes a new object as a copy of an existing object.

**2. Destructor**: A destructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is deleted.

It is used to release resources (like memory, files, or connections) acquired by the object.

##### Key Features

- Same name as the class but preceded with a tilde.

- No parameters, no return type.

- Only one destructor per class (cannot be overloaded).

- Automatically invoked when an object is destroyed.
